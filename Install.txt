Requirements
============

1. Interpreter (mandatory)

   EITHER: 

     A recent version of GNU Octave.
     http://www.gnu.org/software/octave

     with the optim package from Octaveforge
     http://octave.sourceforge.net.

   OR 

     MathWorks MATLAB
     http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab

2. Gmsh (recommended)

   http://geuz.org/gmsh

   While the code all operates without Gmsh installed it is not very 
   easy to use without it for constructing and viewing meshes.

3. The nlopt package (optional) 

   http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt

4. CMake (optional)

   http://www.cmake.org

   CMake is used to configure, install and test the package, however, the 
   installation can easily be done manually. See below.

5. HDF5 (optional)

   http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

   The command line tools from the HDF5 package are required 
   for AMELET-HDF support. On Linux these are often provided 
   in a package called hdf5-tools.

6. Mercurial (optional)

   http://mercurial.selenic.com

   The upstream source is mantained in a Mercurial repository.


Quick Start On Linux
====================

1. EITHER: Use mercurial to clone the source code repository on Bitbucket:

   $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/uoyaeg/aegmesher aegmesher-working

   OR 

   Download a zip file of the source code from

   https://bitbucket.org/uoyaeg/aegmesher/downloads

   and unzip it into a directory call eagmesher-working

   $ unzip aeg-aegmesher-x12ey12ey.zip
   $ mv aeg-aegmesher-x12ey12ey aegmesher-working

2. Run tests and install:

   $ mkdir aegmesher-build_linux_$(arch)
   $ cd eagmesher-build_linux_$(arch)
   $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME -D WITH_MESHER=ON -D WITH_GMSH=ON -D WITH_AMELET=ON -D WITH_CONCEPT=ON -D WITH_GVULTURE=ON ../aegmesher-working
   $ make
   $ make test

   Specific tests can be run using:

   $ ctest -R "WireBox_*" -D ExperimentalTest

   To run specific tests logging full output to file (useful for debugging):

   $ ctest -V -R "BLADE1_*" -D ExperimentalTest | tee output.txt

3. Install the software with

   $ make install

   will install the m-files in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/octave/packages/mesh
   which should be added to your MATLAB/Octave path.


Manual Install
==============

At the end of step 1 above copy the sub-directory mesh from the mesh-working directory
to somewhere and add it to your Octave/MATLAB path.
