 * Mapper fails with physically small objects (e.g. test case
   NonWovenMesh if metres are used instead of mm). Indicates
   some scale invariance in the tolerance parameters.

   This could be related to the parallel ray detection heuristic!

 * Mapper may be putting MBs in top cell of smesh.elements which should
   only be use for TBs/TWs in plane of external surface on high coords
   faces.
 
 * Tests BLADE1_surfchk fails because gmsh -check regards repeated elements as 
   errors. These aren't really failures but a difference in semantics 
   in the use of the gmsh file format.
