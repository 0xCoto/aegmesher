 * Mapper fails with physically small objects (e.g. test case
   NonWovenMesh if metres are used instead of mm). Indicates
   some scale invariance in the tolerance parameters.

   This could be related to the parallel ray detection heuristic!

 * Tests *_surfchk often fails because gmsh -check regards repeated 
   elements as errors. These aren't really failures but a difference 
   in semantics in the use of the gmsh file format.
